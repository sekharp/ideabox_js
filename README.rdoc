# IdeaBox2.0

### Not your basic CRUD app!

##### What?
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

##### How?  -  Tech Stack
Throughout the project, one of my focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server.
